# 🍭 Candy Sale

- It's the day after Halloween 🎃 and all the candy is on sale!

- To buy up all the candy, use map() and filter() to put all the
candy (and only the candy!) into a `shoppingCart` array. 

- The new array should contain only the item and the price, like
this: 

Expected output: 
```
[
    {item: "🍭", price: 2.99},
    {item: "🍫", price: 1.99}, 
    {item: "🍬", price: 0.89}
]
```
